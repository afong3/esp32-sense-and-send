# esp32-sense-and-send
An 18m flume in the Flume Lab at UBC can benefit from having better water surface level data during experiments. The flume is already equipped with a Parker linear rail that traverses the length of the flume. This project is to avoid the mess of adding another wire connection to the cart on the linear rail. Another ESP32 is needed for ESP-NOW.
